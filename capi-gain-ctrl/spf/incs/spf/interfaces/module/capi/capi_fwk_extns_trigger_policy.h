/** @weakgroup weakf_capi_chapter_trigger_policy
The Trigger Policy framework extension (#FWK_EXTN_TRIGGER_POLICY) determines
when the capi_vtbl_t::process() function is called for a module. Most modules
are called when all input ports have data and output ports have buffers (the
default policy of the framework). Input data and output buffers are defined as
follows:
- Data buffer, or data, refers to a buffer that has some data. In the context
  of a process() call, input ports have data.
- Empty buffer, or buffer, refers to a buffer that is ready to accept data.
  In the context of a process() call, output ports have a buffer.

For multiport and buffering modules, complex triggers are possible (for
example, when process() is called because input data is available, or because
an output buffer is available).

@heading2{Types of Triggers}
@xreflabel{hdr:triggerTypes}

Containers are triggered in two ways:
- Data or buffer trigger -- If a container thread is awakened by data or a
  buffer, the current trigger for processing is called a <i>data trigger</i>.
- Signal trigger -- Certain containers can have signal-triggered
  (timer-triggered) modules. If a container is awakened by a signal, the
  current trigger is called a <i>signal trigger</i>.

The policy used to call the module is based on the current trigger. If the
current trigger is based on signals, the signal trigger policy is used;
otherwise, the data trigger policy is used.

@note1hang A trigger policy is only one of the conditions for calling modules.
           Other conditions for calling the modules (such as meeting a
           threshold or if ports are started) must also be satisfied
           independently.

A module can leave either or both policies as NULL. In this case, the default
policy is used, which means all ports are mandatory:
- All input ports get input data
- All output ports get a buffer when the timer trigger causes a graph
to be processed.

If input data is not present, an underrun (underflow) occurs (erasure flag is
set). If output is not present, an overrun (overflow) occurs.

A signal trigger policy is not useful if there is no signal trigger module in
the container. Only under special conditions is a module required to implement
a signal trigger policy: when the module is used in a signal-triggered
container and the default policy does not work. Typically, the default policy
works for most modules, for example, a SISO module might behave as a source
during calibration time. @newpage

If a module requires a data trigger policy in a signal-triggered container,
the module must explicitly enable the policy through
#FWK_EXTN_EVENT_ID_DATA_TRIGGER_IN_ST_CNTR. Data triggers are handled in the
middle of signal triggers.

The schema for defining a trigger policy is the same for both signal triggers
and data triggers, but the actual callbacks are different.

@heading2{Triggerable Ports}
@xreflabel{hdr:triggerablePorts}

The trigger policy is described in two levels, ports and group of ports.

@note1hang A port in a triggerable group can belong to multiple groups.

@heading3{Mandatory Policy}

For the mandatory policy (#FWK_EXTN_PORT_TRIGGER_POLICY_MANDATORY), ports in
each group are ANDed. That is, all ports in the group must satisfy the trigger
condition (present or absent).

Multiple groups are ORed. That is, a module process() is called as long as
at least one group has a trigger.

Using the ports/groups and present/absent notion, any Boolean expression can be
satisfied. For example:
- The module process() might be called when either of the inputs (a or b) and
  output (c) are present: ac + bc, where ac forms the first group, and bc forms
  the second group.
- The module process() might be called in an XOR condition of inputs
  a^b = (!a)b + a(!b), where (!a) indicates the absence of input a.
- The module process() might be called when either inputs (a, b) or output (c)
  is present. There are three groups: a+b+c.

@heading3{Optional Policy}

For the optional policy (#FWK_EXTN_PORT_TRIGGER_POLICY_OPTIONAL), ports in each
group are ORed and multiple groups are ORed. For example, (a+c)(b+c). Thus, the
module process() is called for a module when a timer trigger occurs OR all
ports in at least one group have a trigger.

The framework calls capi_vtbl_t::process() if any one of the OR conditions is
satisfied. In this case, the module also must check which OR condition is
actually satisfied before processing. For example, if the module asks for the
(abc + def) trigger policy, when process() is called, the module must check
that either abc or def is satisfied.

@newpage
@heading2{Non-triggerable Ports and Blocked Ports}
@xreflabel{hdr:nontriggerPortsBlockedPorts}

Apart from groups, there are optional non-triggerable ports and blocked
ports. Both non-triggerable and blocked ports belong to a non-triggerable group
that is ignored when the framework determines whether to call
capi_vtbl_t::process() on a module.

@note1hang A port cannot belong to both triggerable and non-triggerable groups.

@heading3{Non-triggerable Ports}

Optional non-triggerable ports never trigger a capi_vtbl_t::process() call.
However, if a module is triggered due to other ports, and if these ports also
have a trigger at that time, the ports carry the data and output.

@heading3{Blocked Ports}

An input or output port must not be given when calling capi_vtbl_t::process()
on the module, even though buffer or data might be present.

@note1hang Blocked ports do not apply for timer (signal) triggers.

@heading2{Default Trigger Policy}

The default data or buffer trigger policy for all modules is <i>All ports must
have triggers</i>. This policy is the same as having all groups in one group.

Upon an algorithm reset, port reset, or other resets, the trigger policy is not
reset. Also, for module enable and disable operations, modules must explicitly
issue a callback.

In a group, if a port is mandatory but it is stopped, the module will not get a
call unless the stopped port is removed from the group.
