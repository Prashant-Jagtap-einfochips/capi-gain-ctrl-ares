/** @weakgroup weakf_capi_chapter_dataport_op
The Data Port Operation interface extension (#INTF_EXTN_DATA_PORT_OPERATION)
defines port operations (open, start, stop, close).

Most simple PP modules might not be required to implement this extension.
Modules such as EC, buffering modules, mixer, splitter, and so on might be
required to implement it.

@heading2{Open}

The open operation (#INTF_EXTN_DATA_PORT_OPEN) communicates the
port ID-to-index mapping that the modules might want to cache for future use.

When a new data connection is made to a module, a data port is opened. This
operation is set for ports that were opened immediately when the module was
created as well as for any ports that are opened after module creation.

@heading2{Start}

The start operation (#INTF_EXTN_DATA_PORT_START) indicates that the framework
started providing buffers on the given ports.

On an input port, the start operation indicates that the subgraph containing
the module and the upstream operations of the module on this port are all
started.

On an output port, the start operation indicates that the subgraph containing
the module and the downstream operations of the module on this port are all
started.

@heading2{Stop}

The start operation (#INTF_EXTN_DATA_PORT_STOP) indicates that the framework
stopped providing buffers on the stopped port.

On an input port, the stop operation indicates that the subgraph containing the
module is stopped. Upstream stop is indicated through metadata (EOS), not
through port operation. The metadata method helps to drain data instead of
dropping it at once.

On an output port, the stop operation indicates that the subgraph containing
the module or any downstream operations of the module on this port are stopped.

@heading2{Close}

The close operation (#INTF_EXTN_DATA_PORT_CLOSE) is issued when a module is
closing or when the connection to an input or output port is removed. If a stop
was not issued before this close, a stop is also issued before the close.

When an input port in the data flowing state is closed, modules that handle
metadata must insert an internal EOS on all corresponding outputs. This tells
downstream operations about the upstream gap.

Open ports are not required to be closed for symmetry. For example,
#INTF_EXTN_DATA_PORT_OPEN need not be completed by #INTF_EXTN_DATA_PORT_CLOSE.

When the input port of a metadata handling module (which implements
#INTF_EXTN_METADATA) is closed, and if the data flow state of the port is not
already at-gap, an internal EOS might be required to be inserted at this input
port and eventually propagated to corresponding outputs. This internal EOS
serves as a way to indicate upstream data flow gap. The framework takes care of
this for modules that do not handle metadata.

Related to the data port operations: closed, opened, started, stopped,
   suspended. & States are: Data is Flowing and Data Flow is at Gap (DFG).
   \tn \hline
Directly related to the port operations. & State change is due to data
   arrival at a port, or EOS or DFG metadata departure from a port.
   \tn \hline
State change is due to an SPF client sending a subgraph management command on
   the self or downstream peers. & State change is due to any gap in the data
   flow. For example: an SPF client sends a subgraph management command on the
   self or upstream peers; or an EOS either comes from the client or is due to
   an upstream pause.
